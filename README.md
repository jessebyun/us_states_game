<h2>U.S. States Game</h2>

This is a learning game where the player guesses all the states in the United States. When the player guesses the correct state, it will label that state on the map. The game ends once the player guesses all the states. Player can exit the game by typing "exit" and the game will generate a CSV file with all the states the player could not guess.
